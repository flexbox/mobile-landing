## About

weshipit.today is a French-based React Native engineering and consulting company. We partner with the worldâ€™s top companies and are recommended by Expo. You donâ€™t have time to learn all the details of mobile app development? Letâ€™s build together and **book a call with us:â€¯[weshipit.today](https://weshipit.today/)**.

### Why this project?

This project is designed to help you create a landing page for your Expo application. It provides a simple and customizable solution for showcasing your app, including features like:

Demo: [mobile-landing.expo.app](https://mobile-landing.expo.app/)

## Getting Started

Create a new Expo app using the template:

```bash
npx create-expo -t https://github.com/flexbox/mobile-landing/ <project-mobile-landing>
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn       # or npm install
yarn start # or npm start
```

## Configure your landing page

1. Update your iOS and android configuration in `app.config.ts`.

- If you provide your App Store ID, the app will automatically fetch your app data (name, description, screenshots).
- In case the automatic fetch fails, you can still manually configure all the data.

2. Update your theme on `constants/theme.ts`.
3. Update your landing page content on `constants/landing.ts`.
4. Run `yarn generate-og` to generate a screenshot of your landing page, then manually move the generated image from your downloads folder to the `public` directory.

## App Store Data

The app can fetch App Store data in two ways:

1. **Dynamic mode (development)**: When running in development, the app will try to fetch data from the App Store API if no static data is available.

2. **Static mode (production)**: For production deployments, the app uses pre-fetched data stored in a local JSON file.

To manually fetch and update the App Store data:

```bash
yarn fetch-appstore-data
```

This will create a JSON file at `assets/data/appStore.json` with your app's data.

When you run `yarn deploy`, this command is automatically executed before deployment to ensure you have the latest data.

## Release

1. Create an account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)
2. Install the cli `npm install -g eas-cli`
3. Login to your account `eas login`

```bash
yarn preview # or npm run preview
```

Release to production

```bash
yarn deploy # or npm run deploy
```

## Changelog

The app includes a changelog page that can be enabled or disabled. To manage the changelog:

1. Open `constants/landing.ts`
2. Find the `changelog` configuration object
3. Set `enabled: true` to show the changelog page, or `enabled: false` to hide it
4. Add your versions and changes in the following format:

```typescript
{
  version: "2.0.0",
  date: "2024-03-15",
  changes: [
    {
      type: "feature", // Can be: feature, improvement, fix
      description: "Description of the change"
    }
  ]
}
```

The changelog page will automatically show your changes with appropriate styling for each type of change:

- ðŸŸ£ Feature: New features
- ðŸ”µ Improvement: Enhancements to existing features
- ðŸ”´ Fix: Bug fixes and corrections
